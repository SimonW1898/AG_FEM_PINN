4.1 
analytical solution absolute value, say way only absolute value 3D
FEM:
fem solution at three different time steps t = 0, t = 0.5, t = 1.0 3D
2d plot, error vs time for different grid resolutions
2d plot, error vs grid resolution for different time steps
2d plot, error vs time for different time resolutions
PINNs:
pinn solution at three different time steps t = 0, t = 0.5, t = 1.0 3D
2d plot, error vs time, maybe real and imaginary part seperately
pde loss over time

4.2 
plot potential in 3d for different times t = 0 and for one period
plot initial condition as solution of the time-independent model potential in 3d
FEM:
fem solution at ten different time steps
PINNs:
pinn solution at ten different time steps




discussion:
idea: train/propagate pinns and fems for different settings as plot error vs wall time
